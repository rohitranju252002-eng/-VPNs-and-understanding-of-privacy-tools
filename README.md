## üõ† Steps Performed

1. **Chose a Free VPN Service**
   - Selected **ProtonVPN Free** (reputable and no data logging policy).

2. **Downloaded & Installed VPN Client**
   - Installed the official ProtonVPN application from [protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com).

3. **Connected to a VPN Server**
   - Connected to the closest server for better performance.

4. **Verified IP Address Change**
   - Before VPN: `103.xx.xx.xx` (original ISP IP).  
   - After VPN: `185.xx.xx.xx` (VPN server IP).  
   - Verified using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).

5. **Tested Encrypted Browsing**
   - Browsed multiple websites.  
   - Verified traffic encryption by checking HTTPS and VPN status icon.

6. **Disconnected & Compared Performance**
   - After disconnecting, IP reverted to original ISP address.  
   - Browsing speed was **slightly slower** while on VPN due to encryption overhead.

## üîç Research on VPN Encryption & Privacy
- VPNs use **AES-256 encryption** (industry standard).  
- **Protocols used** include OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, WireGuard.  
- VPNs **mask the user‚Äôs IP address**, improving privacy.  
- Many VPNs include **DNS leak protection** and **kill switches** to prevent accidental data leaks.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Using a VPN
- Hides **real IP address** and location.  
- Protects data with **strong encryption**.  
- Prevents ISP tracking and throttling.  
- Secures connections on **public Wi-Fi**.  
- Allows bypassing of geo-restrictions (e.g., content blocked in certain countries).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of VPNs
- **Slower browsing speeds** due to encryption and rerouting.  
- Free VPNs may have **limited servers, bandwidth, and speed**.  
- Some VPN providers may **log user data** (avoid non-reputable services).  
- VPN does **not make you completely anonymous** ‚Äî websites may still track users through cookies, browser fingerprinting, etc.  
- Certain services may **block known VPN IP ranges**.

---

## üèÜ Conclusion
VPNs are a valuable tool for **privacy, encryption, and online safety**, but they come with limitations such as reduced speed and possible trust issues with providers. A **reputable VPN service** with no-logs policy and strong encryption is essential for effective protection.
